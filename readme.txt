--- what is this for

    This is a simple plugin to make ores drop their ingots instead of ore blocks. There is fortune support, so that you
    can get more ingots from a single ore. Only works with Iron and Gold, as those ores drop ore blocks instead of
    ingots.

--- building

    To build FireAspect, run `mvn clean compile package` inside this directory. The plugin file created will be at
    `target/FireAspect-<version>.jar`
